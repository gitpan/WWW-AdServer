Apache::Emulator
================

Installation
------------

The usual ...

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install

Hmm... Then I found out some problems...

If you don't have the following packages installed (which you probably won't):
Apache
Apache::Constants

...you'll need to set up some stub modules within your libpath, that look like this:

[ in file /some/perl/lib/path/Apache.pm ]
package Apache;
1;

[ in file /some/perl/lib/path/Apache/Constants.pm ]
package Apache::Constants;
1;


The problem is due to Perl looking for the files Apache.pm and Constants.pm before I've had chance to override their methods. Ho hum - such is the joy of Perl!
