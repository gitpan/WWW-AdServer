WWW::AdServer
=============

This is a replacement of the WWW::AdServer module of Nigel Wetters Gourlay
that was based on mod_perl. At this point it does not try to provide backward
compatibility. The old version can still be found on CPAN at
http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/N/NW/NWETTERS/WWW-AdServer-0.02.tar.gz


At one point this module should be able to run the [Perl Community AdServer](http://pcas.szabgab.com/)

It should also be able to run the ads on the [Perl Maven](http://perlmaven.com/) site.
